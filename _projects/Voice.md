VOICE transforms text into natural-sounding speech using advanced neural networks. The platform processes over 10,000 synthesis requests daily with sub-200ms latency.

## What it does

**Core functionality**: Convert written text to high-quality speech in multiple voices and languages. The system supports real-time streaming for live applications and batch processing for content creation.

**Voice variety**: 25+ distinct voice models including male, female, and character voices. Each model trained on 100+ hours of clean audio data.

## Technical approach

Built on a transformer-based architecture with custom attention mechanisms. The pipeline includes:

1. **Text preprocessing** - Handles punctuation, abbreviations, and pronunciation rules
2. **Phoneme prediction** - Converts text to phonetic representations
3. **Audio synthesis** - Generates mel-spectrograms using modified Tacotron2
4. **Vocoding** - Converts spectrograms to audio with WaveGlow

## Usage examples

```python
from voice_api import VoiceClient

client = VoiceClient(api_key="your_key")
response = client.synthesize(
    text="Hello world", 
    voice="emma_professional",
    speed=1.0
)
```

**Real-world applications**:
- Podcast narration for independent creators
- Accessibility features for reading apps
- Customer service phone systems
- Educational content localization

## Performance metrics

- **Latency**: 180ms average end-to-end
- **Quality**: 4.2/5.0 MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
- **Uptime**: 99.7% over 12 months
- **Languages**: English, Spanish, French, German

The project sparked interest from accessibility advocates and led to partnerships with three education technology companies.
