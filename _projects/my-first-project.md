A collaborative task management application built for small teams who needed something more flexible than existing tools. TaskFlow emphasized speed and simplicity over feature complexity.

## The problem

Existing task managers felt bloated for small creative teams. They needed something that could handle:

- **Quick task creation** without complex forms
- **Visual project timelines** to spot bottlenecks
- **Real-time collaboration** without constant notifications
- **Simple time tracking** that didn't feel like surveillance

## Solution approach

Built a single-page application focusing on keyboard shortcuts and minimal clicks. The core workflow:

1. **Rapid input**: Type tasks in natural language ("Design homepage by Friday for @sarah")
2. **Smart parsing**: Automatically extract assignees, dates, and priorities
3. **Visual organization**: Kanban boards with swimlanes for team members
4. **Gentle reminders**: Contextual notifications only when relevant

## Technical implementation

**Frontend**: React with custom drag-and-drop components. Used Context API for state management to avoid Redux complexity.

**Backend**: Node.js with Express, JWT authentication, and real-time updates via Socket.io.

**Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching and session management.

```javascript
// Example of natural language task parsing
const parseTask = (input) => {
  const assigneeMatch = input.match(/@(\w+)/);
  const dateMatch = input.match(/by (\w+)/i);
  
  return {
    title: input.replace(/@\w+|by \w+/gi, '').trim(),
    assignee: assigneeMatch?.[1],
    dueDate: parseDate(dateMatch?.[1])
  };
};
```

## Key features delivered

**Smart task entry**: Natural language parsing reduced task creation time by 60% compared to traditional forms.

**Timeline view**: Gantt-style visualization helped teams identify scheduling conflicts before they became problems.

**Mobile optimization**: Responsive design worked well on tablets for field work and client meetings.

**Export capabilities**: CSV and PDF exports for client reporting and project archives.

## Results and lessons

**Usage**: Piloted with 3 design agencies (25 total users) over 6 months. Teams reported 30% faster project completion.

**What worked**: The natural language input was surprisingly popular. Users loved being able to quickly dump thoughts without context switching.

**What didn't**: Real-time features created notification fatigue. Simpler async updates would have been better.

**Why archived**: Product-market fit was strong, but maintaining a task management SaaS requires significant ongoing support resources that weren't available at the time.

The project taught valuable lessons about user experience design and the importance of focusing on core workflows rather than feature breadth. Code and documentation archived on GitHub for future reference.
