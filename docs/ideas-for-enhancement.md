*These enhancements follow the "Kaizen" principle of continuous subtle improvements that enhance the reading experience without overwhelming the contemplative, cozy aesthetic. Each should be evaluated against the core principle: "Does this serve comfortable, focused reading?"*

**Principles to Remember:**
- **Reading comes first**: Every enhancement should serve comfortable reading
- **Subtle over flashy**: Understated elegance beats attention-grabbing
- **Lagom**: Just the right amount - not too much, not too little
- **Mys**: Maintain the cozy, contemplative feeling
