# ADR-20250613: Embeddings System Archive

## Decision
Archived incomplete embeddings system to improve build reliability

## Rationale
- System caused consistent build warnings
- Complexity outweighed benefits
- Preserved all code for potential future use

## Consequences
- Positive: Faster builds, fewer errors
- Negative: Loss of potential future functionality
